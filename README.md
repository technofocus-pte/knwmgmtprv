# Knowledge Management using Microsoft 365

Knowledge management plays a vital role in delivering world-class customer care. With knowledge management, team members in an organization can author, categorize, deliver, analyze, and share information through a knowledge base.

1. Primary service providers, such as agents, can look up information in a knowledge base to resolve customer queries right away, and increase their productivity.

2. With access to rich, high-quality knowledge resources across consistent and contextual Omnichannel experiences, agents can resolve issues faster and reduce their average call handling time.

3. Customers can use knowledge management search capabilities across channels to resolve issues for themselves. The results are fewer support tickets and higher customer satisfaction.
